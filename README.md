HTML and CSS In-Depth Project

This repository contains the final project that I created while studying the Meta Professional Front End Dev Certificate, specifically the section on HTML and CSS in depth.

The project consists of a web page that showcases different types of ice cream flavors, along with their descriptions and prices. The page was built using HTML and CSS, and it features responsive design, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes.

The main goal of the project was to apply the knowledge acquired during the course and demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS concepts such as semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques, and responsive design.

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Alternatively, you can also clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file from there.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me through the repository's issues page.
